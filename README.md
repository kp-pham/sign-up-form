# sign-up-form

The sign-up form project is about the implementation of the sign-up form for an imaginary service. Given the design of the website, create the website from scratch and implement the sign-up form for users to enter their personal information, contact information, and create the password for their account. The project allows for practice with the implementation of forms and form validation in preparation for server-side validation. The project also allows for practice with more advanced CSS properties compared to the CSS properties learned in the Foundaions course.
